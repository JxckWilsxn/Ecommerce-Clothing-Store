# Ecommerence-Clothing-Store

## Description
This is an e-commerce project made by myself that demonstrates both vanilla CSS and vanilla JavaScript skills.

The clothing store allows the user to browse items and reviews, as well as be able to add items to the cart. The cart will add all the items together to calculate the total price along with the discount deduction and shipping cost applied.
